# Overview
This is a prototype where the player can pick up powerups to defeat enemys (white spheres).

# Install
If you want to test it, you'll need [unity engine](https://unity.com/download) installed. Then download "*ExportedPackage.unitypackage*" and import it as an asset.

# Live Preview
Here's a [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_VA6euaxAnsjJYD-DNetuCifTusxnpCd/view?usp=sharing) of me testing this game so you don't have to download it.

# Missing
- I would like to add some kind of UI where the player can see the current wave of the game and the actual score.

# Future improvements
- Improve the spawnManager script to use some kind of object pooling and make the game more efficient.
- Improve the spawnManager so it can only spawn enemys when there are no enemys alive.
