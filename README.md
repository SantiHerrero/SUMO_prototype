# Overview
This is a prototype where the player can pick up powerups to defeat enemys (white spheres).

# Missing
- I would like to add some kind of UI where the player can see the current wave of the game and the actual score.

# Future improvements
- Improve the spawnManager script to use some kind of object pooling and make the game more efficient.
- Improve the spawnManager so it can only spawn enemys when there are no enemys alive.
